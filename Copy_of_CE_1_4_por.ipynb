Pfizer has said it has not observed a higher rate of the condition, known as myocarditis, than would normally be expected in the general population.  In Israel, 275 cases of myocarditis were reported between December 2020 and May 2021 among more than 5 million vaccinated people, the ministry said, in disclosing the findings of a study it commissioned to examine the matter. Most patients who experienced heart inflammation spent no more than four days in hospital and 95% of the cases were classified as mild, according to the study, which the ministry said was conducted by three teams of experts. The study found “there is a probable link between receiving the second dose (of Pfizer) vaccine and the appearance of myocarditis among men aged 16 to 30,” it said in a statement.  \n",

            " Scotland is entering a “third wave” of coronavirus, according to the national clinical director, as Nicola Sturgeon paused plans to ease Covid restrictions in much of the country. The First Minister insisted the country was still at a “delicate and fragile point” in the battle with the virus, in an announcement on restrictions which she described as a “mixed bag”. Jason Leitch warned the Indian variant “is causing us some challenge and is spreading quicker than we hoped”. When asked by BBC Radio Scotland’s Drivetime if the country was at the start of a third wave he replied: “Yes, I think we are. “The question is how big that third wave is - everybody, every modelling higher education institution... they all said, if you open you will get more cases. “Now I’m not sure I needed a university to tell me that, I think people in the street would have told me that. “The question is, whether you control that to a level that doesn’t cause enough severe disease to fill hospitals, and enough severe disease to cause misery and death to families.  “That’s the balance we’re now trying to strike and the advice we’ve given and the decisions the First Minister and the Cabinet have made today.”  As part of those decisions the First Minister confirmed Glasgow, which had been under the strictest restrictions in Scotland, will see these relaxed, with the city moving to Level 2 from Saturday, PA reports.  On that date, many island communities will move to Level 0 - the lowest level there is under Scotland’s five tier system - while 15 council areas will step down to Level 1.  But 13 local authority areas, including Edinburgh, Dundee and Stirling, will remain in Level 2 for the time being. Updated\n",

            " A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Reuters reports:   Brazil administered 21 million COVID-19 shots in May, down 14.2% from the 24.5 million vaccines injected in April, according to data compiled by the federally funded Fiocruz and state Health Departments.   More than 10.5 million second doses were given in April, compared with 6.6 million last month, the data show. Experts said a lack of shots, coupled with misinformation about vaccines, had led millions of Brazilians to only take one dose so far. A lack of chemical ingredients, mainly delivered from China, has caused Brazil’s two main vaccine production hubs, Fiocruz and the Butantan institute in Sao Paulo, to temporarily pause production of their respective shots. Fiocruz is making the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, while Butantan is manufacturing a shot developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Carlos Lula, president of the National Council of Health Secretaries (Conass), said about 5 million people had so far not shown up to take their second dose. “Conass is talking to the Health Ministry and seeing what we can do to speed up vaccinations,” he told Reuters.  \n",

            " Mark McGowan has given an update on the hotel quarantine breach in WA – a returned traveler caught the virus from another returned traveler in a different room: Because of the measures we have put in place, the Chief Health Officer has assessed it as a low-risk hotel.  It just goes to show that hotel quarantine was not built for these purposes. This is something we are doing our very best, our utmost to cope with, but there is always risk.  That is not the preferred policy. The written advice is that you do not move a person from the room next door for a range of reasons.  The first reason is that, if you do, that person might already be positive and the risk to other people in the hotel. Secondly it takes around five staff to move that person. Security, other people taking baggage and there is a risk in moving that person.  Thirdly, when you move that person you have to clean that room which has some risk associated with that and fourthly there is limited capacity within the hotel so once you move that one, you probably have to move the rooms around that person.  There is a whole range of knock-on effects. The written advice we have is you do not move people in these circumstances.  Obviously, I queried that at length, at length because it does not accord with what you might think but that is the advice we get from all our health professionals. It is better to leave a person next to a single positive case rather than to move them.  \n",

The government is going to be crowing about this - because it looks like measures in the October budget, such as instant expensing, have increased business investment and HomeBuilder has spurred construction activity. The ABS said: Both business and housing investment increased, supported by government initiatives and improved confidence. Business investment was driven by a 11.6% rise in machinery and equipment, the strongest increase since December quarter 2009. Dwelling investment rose 6.4% with increased construction activity on renovations and detached housing, coinciding with the federal government’s HomeBuilder scheme. Updated\n",

All we know for sure is that the signs have not been looking overly good for the lockdown ending as scheduled on Thursday. With more than 500 exposure sites and a more virulent strain of the virus, authorities are worried they have not caught all the cases as yet.

School holidays means travel though, and Vic Police have already made it clear that the ‘ring of steel’ approach (stopping movement between Melbourne and the regions) is resource intensive.

State health authorities are investigating how the transmission took place. It is the latest in a long list of breaches in hotel quarantine across the country. “This would be the 21st (breach) according to our own records of issues within hotel quarantine,” Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly told a Senate hearing. “But we have to think about what the background is, that 352,000 people have come through hotel quarantine over that period.” Federal health officials said there had been no other transmissions detected in WA’s hotel quarantine system after the case emerged. \n",

One new overseas-acquired case was recorded in the same period, bringing the  total number of cases in NSW since the beginning of the pandemic to 5,399. There were 21,551 tests reported to 8pm last night, compared with the previous day’s total of 9,801.

Butler: There are different estimates from different economists but it is broadly agreed that a week lockdown is costing about $1 billion, and if it is extended, it will be hundreds and hundreds of millions additionally with the lockdown in Perth, the hotels industry said it cost $150 million just over three days.  Treasury said at estimates yesterday that they have factored into their budget estimate that there would be, on average, three-week long lockdowns every quarter over the course of the coming year so the economic cost is there for all to see and that does not mention distress, the mental anguish, the isolation involved in this.  Just on economics, it is also accounted to say we are not going to stop these hotel breaches when we see the broad economic costs, let alone the non- economic costs of these lockdowns.  We also know that this pandemic is not going away anytime soon and we know, from advice, that there is always the risk of future pandemics so we should spend a dime now to prevent these regular breaches from hotels built for tourism and not quarantine.

Butler: We have had so many messages from the government. Peter Dutton, the defence minister, described the Victorian proposal as smoke and mirrors and yet now it would appear the government is putting some effort into giving a proper assessment to the Victorian proposal.  Last night, we heard from the health department that they had not even been asked to assess the Toowoomba proposal ... the prime minister in particular [needs to realise] it is not his job to sit back and wait for proposals to come forward.  The Commonwealth is responsible for quarantine and they have received advice after advice or purpose-built facilities.  The former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett has said we need to other facilities in addition to Alice Springs.  They should be seeking proposals for a network of facilities to take the pressure off our hotel system which is leaking the virus almost on a weekly and fortnightly basis and was built for tourism purposes.

            " Labor MP Clare O’Neil was a guest on RN Breakfast this morning, where she was asked by Hamish Macdonald why Victoria ‘can’t seem to get on top of outbreaks’ like other states. Her answer has caused a little flurry on social media, after she compared movement in Sydney and Melbourne. I‘m in lockdown in my home in Victoria, right now. It feels like a little bit of an unfair question and we’ve got to remember that this outbreak actually came through a leak from South Australian quarantine. You would have heard a number of epidemiologists answering the question that you’ve just asked me over previous days and so I don’t want to get into the science too deeply as that’s really their role.  But, I think, they’ve referred to a bunch of specific things about Victoria - the layout of the city, for example, is one where people move around a lot more than they do versus Sydney, for example, where people tend to stay within their suburbs or their regions.  But, the most important thing that’s happening right now in Victoria, Hamish, is that we are dealing with a much more contagious form of Covid than we’ve seen in any previous outbreaks. You mentioned, in your opener there, that we’ve had situations in Victoria where people have caught Covid from one another by brushing past one another in a store. This has never happened before in a Covid outbreak and I personally am glad that the Victorian government’s being pretty conservative. We’ll get on to aged care in a minute but we know, through bitter, bitter experience, the agony that can be caused when we don’t get on top of outbreaks and we’re proud as Victorians that we’re working together as a community to protect people that are vulnerable.  At least in my feed, Sydney residents seem incensed at being described as dwelling in the suburbs a little more. But an epidemiologist did say it: Professor Mary-Louise McLaws attempts to answer one of journalists' most tiresome questions: \"Why does this keep happening to Victoria?\"Note: Luck is also a big component.#afternoonbriefing #melbournelockdown #journalism #MorrisonLockdown #IStandWithDan #auspol pic.twitter.com/VDKiO8AbRw Updated\n",

            "What ingredients are required to make an ultramarathon runner? In Boulder, Colorado, Scott Jurek has concocted quite the recipe that has kept him going the distance for the past two decades. He runs anywhere between 50 miles to over 150 miles, and in his lifetime has won over 20 ultramarathons, smashing records along the way. His passion for running kickstarted his morning regimen in 1997, when he cut out meat completely. In 1999, he transitioned to a plant-based diet, which has since fueled his long-distance running career. On an average day, Scott runs about 10 miles, and this is typically before the sun rises over the beautiful Boulder Flatirons. What we do when we wake up in the morning sets the tone for our days and ultimately shapes our lives. In this new series, we take a look at how the hyper-successful among us have leveraged rituals to create the trajectories they want.

            " The Biden administration formally ended the Trump-era “remain in Mexico” policy that forced thousands of asylum seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico while the US to process their cases.  The administration had paused the program in January. In a memo sent to agency leaders today, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the policy did not “adequately or sustainably enhance border management.”  In March, Valerie Gonzalez wrote for the Guardian about the impact of Biden pausing the remain in Mexico policy earlier this year:  A dusty soccer ball lay idle and forgotten a few days ago at an empty dwelling that had been knitted together from billowing, fraying plastic tarps tied to dead trees in the Mexican city of Matamoros. The vignette of the abandoned shelter is expected to replicate across the makeshift migrant camp in the coming weeks, wedged between the edge of the city and the swirling Rio Grande, across the border from south-east Texas. Hundreds have been hovering, somewhere between living and existing, since 2019 under Donald Trump’s program known as “Remain in Mexico” while their immigration cases are processed in the US. After several 11th-hour delays, people are now starting to depart the camp to argue their asylum cases in the United States. Nearly 25,000 people out of at least 70,000 who crossed the US-Mexico border and were sent back, under the policy known more formally as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), are now eligible to be reprocessed on the US side. Joe Biden pledged “more fair, orderly and humane” immigration processes and has ordered the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review MPP. If squalid, dangerous camps in places like Matamoros become obsolete, few will mourn. Although Biden has reversed many of Trump’s most restrictive border policies, he has left in place Title 42 – a provision that allows the US to send back migrants arriving at the southern border due to the pandemic. Immigration advocates say the policy blocks access for many asylum seekers who arrive at the US-Mexico border, trapping them in unsafe conditions.  Updated\n",

            " Kari Paul Human rights groups are calling on the Biden administration and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to put an end to a digital surveillance program that keeps tabs on nearly 100,000 immigrants. A new report called Ice Digital Prisons, authored by the Latinx organizing group Mijente and immigration legal rights group Just Futures Law, highlights how Ice uses apps, GPS-tracking ankle monitors and facial recognition software to monitor people – saying these tactics “do more harm and inhibit any true progress in providing the social and economic tools for immigrants to thrive in their communities”. The report says that the use of such technologies further criminalizes immigrants and affects their social and economic wellbeing. The Biden administration is under growing pressure to right the wrongs of the Trump administration’s immigration policies and keep families out of detention facilities. One of its solutions has been to stress the importance of funding digital methods for tracking immigrants rather than physically imprisoning them. The digital alternatives program has been growing in recent years, with funding increasing from $28m in 2006 to $440m in 2021. The “alternatives to detention” program tracks 96,574 individuals, but the Biden administration’s 2022 budget request calls to increase that number by approximately 45,000 to 140,000. These alternatives “support migrants as they navigate their legal obligations”, the Biden administration has said, and are meant to be less-harmful alternatives to physical detention. But Julie Mao, an immigration attorney with Just Futures Law and an editor on the report, said that is not the case. Read more:  \n",

            " Daniel Boffey A proposal to be tabled by the US president, Joe Biden, at the upcoming G7 meeting for a 15% global corporate tax rate could reap the EU €50bn (£43bn) a year, and earn the UK nearly €200m extra alone from the British multinational BP, according to research. Should the tax rate be set higher at 25%, the lowest current rate within the seven largest world economies, the EU would earn nearly €170bn extra a year – more than 50% of current corporate tax revenue and 12% of total health spending in the bloc. Among multinationals headquartered in the UK, it is claimed that BP’s corporate tax bill would increase at that rate by €484.9m, Barclays by €911m a year and HSBC’s by €4.2bn. The estimates will be published on Tuesday by a new independent research organisation, the EU Tax Observatory, which models the “tax deficit” of multinationals, defined as the difference between current tax payments and the sums due if global profits were subject to the same rate wherever they are booked. Under Biden’s proposal, multinational corporations would be prevented from shifting profits across borders to exploit the most attractive low-tax locations as their profits would be taxed at a minimum global corporation tax rate either where they are booked or headquartered. The Biden administration initially proposed a rate of 21% but last week revised the target down, saying it should be “at least” 15%, although this is regarded by the White House as a “floor” and that discussions should continue to push that rate higher. The UK chancellor, Rushi Sunak, is understood to be skeptical about higher levels mooted for a minimum corporate tax rate while expressing support for the principle. The Treasury has said they have concerns that the policy could lead to economic activity in the UK being taxed elsewhere. The UK has the lowest corporate tax rate in the G7 at 19% although it will rise to 25% by April 2023. \n",

            " Kamala Harris, who was tapped today to lead the administration’s efforts to protect voting rights, has released a statement endorsing the Democrats’ The For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   “In the last election, more people voted than ever before. Since then, more than 380 bills have been introduced across the country that would make it harder for Americans to vote,” she said. These bills seek to restrict the options that make voting more convenient and accessible, including early voting and vote by mail.” Harris and Joe Biden have long endorsed the Democrats’ two major voting rights bills – which face a steep road ahead. In the Senate, Republicans and some moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia have opposed the For the People Act. Manchin called it “too darn broad” and partisan. He, Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats have also resisted their colleague’s efforts to pass the bill by gutting the filibuster, a procedural obstacle that prevents most bills that don’t have the support of at least 60 senators from ever getting a vote. It’s unclear what, if anything, Harris could do to change these realities. Having served in the Senate for four years, she has some ties in the chamber. But Biden, who served in the chamber for nine times has long, is thought to have much deeper relationships with Senators – and has been unable to win them over.  “I will work with voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide,” Harris said. “And we will also work with members of Congress to help advance these bills.” Harris has also been tasked with diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle, leading the efforts to expand broadband internet and other issues.

            " Joanna Walters Biden closed out his speech in Oklahoma this afternoon by comparing white supremacist atrocities in the past, such as the Tulsa massacre, to extremist threats today. “We must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and an act of domestic terrorism, with a through-line that exists today, still,” he said. “Remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago, on television, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK [Ku Klux Klan], coming out of those fields at night in Virginia, their lighted torches, the veins bulging as they were screaming.”  “Well, [massacre survivor] Mother Fletcher said that when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, it broke her heart,” he continued: “A mob of violent white extremists, thugs, said it reminded her of what happened here, 100 years ago, in Greenwood. Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans, hate that never goes away.” Someone from the audience called out “that’s true”. Biden went on: “And given a little bit of oxygen by its leaders it comes out from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.” “We can’t give hate a safe harbor. According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today,” he said.  Updated\n",
